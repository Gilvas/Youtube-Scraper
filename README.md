# Youtube-Scraper
Web scraping for downloading YouTube videos

## Description
With this program, you can download that video from YouTube to watch it later. 

## Installation
Make sure you have installed [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in your machine and import the pytube module, the latter will be necessary to import the YouTube video data for scraping. The pytube module can be installed as follows:

- open the Command Prompt (cmd)
- type 'pip install pytube'
- check if the pyperclip module has been successfully installed

If you have problems installing the pytube module, please visit the [link to pytube](https://python-pytube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Usage
1. Open the YouTube video you wish to download.
1. Copy the URL of that video.
1. Run the program, via .py, IDLE or cmd.
1. If the link is incorrect, you will see an exception being raised.
1. Follow the instructions on your screen.
1. The code is not case sensitive, which means you can enter: 'Yes, YES, yes' to continue the download.
1. You can also type 'y' and 'Y' to continue the download of the video.
1. The video will be downloaded onto the same directory as this program is found.

## Note
I wrote the code in Windows. Therefore, the shebang line (first line of the code) tells my computer run Python 3 in my operating system Windows. If you use another OS, Linux or OS X, please change that first line to the one which fits you.
